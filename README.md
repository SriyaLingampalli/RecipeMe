We wanted to help people to stay healthy, use their food before it goes bad, and help learn how to cook!
All the user has to do is point their camera at specific food in the pantry or kitchen and our app will idenfity what kind it is through Microsoft's Vision Api and TenserFlow's machine learning. 
Once the app identifies the picture it would save the ingredients into a data base where they can be identified and used to fulfill a number of recipes. 
From all the data from recipes, we hope to keep track of experieation dates and then prioritize recipes that can use up any ingredients that are going bad.
